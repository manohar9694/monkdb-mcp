A **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server acts as a standardized bridge between large language models (LLMs) like Claude and databases such as MonkDB, allowing these models to perform advanced database operations securely and efficiently through natural language instructions.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to let AI systems connect with external data sources and tools. It provides a universal, structured communication channel between:

- **MCP Clients**: AI assistants (e.g., Claude, Cursor.ai) that need data or tool access.
- **MCP Servers**: Services exposing data or functionality (e.g., a MonkDB server) for use by LLMs

## How Does an MCP Server Work with MonkDB?

An MCP server for MonkDB would expose MonkDB’s capabilities as a set of standardized, secure commands that LLMs can invoke. This enables LLMs to:

- **Query the database**: Run searches, filter results, and retrieve specific documents or records.
- **Inspect table/collection schemas**: Understand the structure, fields, and data types in MonkDB tables.
- **Check server health**: Run diagnostics, monitor performance, and report on availability.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Natural Language Interface**: LLMs translate user queries into MCP commands, making database interaction accessible to non-experts.
- **Standardized Protocol**: Ensures consistent authentication, error handling, and data formatting across different clients and servers.
- **Security**: Access control and validation are built into the server, preventing unauthorized or unsafe operations.
- **Scalability**: MCP can support multiple LLM clients and MonkDB instances, facilitating horizontal scaling and robust data access.
- **Extensibility**: New tools or database actions can be added to the MCP server as needed, future-proofing the integration.

## Architecture Overview

| Component    | Role                                                                                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Host         | Embeds the LLM (e.g., a chatbot or IDE)                                                |
| MCP Client   | Mediates between the host and MCP server, routing requests and injecting context       |
| MCP Server   | Exposes MonkDB’s data and tools, handling requests and returning structured results    |

This separation allows for easier integration, better security, and more maintainable code.
